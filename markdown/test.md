!!! note "**By the end of this sub-topic, learners should be able to:**"
    - Express derived units as products or quotients of the base units.
    - Use base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations.
    - Derive physical equations using base units.
    - Demonstrate understanding and use the convention for labelling graph axes and table columns.
    - Use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal sub-multiples or multiples of both base and derived units: pico (p), nano (n), micro (p), milli (m), cent (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G) , tera (T).
    - Determine the resultant of two or more coplanar vectors.
    - Represent a vector as two perpendicular components.

## Physical Quantities

* Measurement is the heart of science in general, and physics in particular. In order to study or learn physics, one must be able to measure quantities.
* When taking a measurement, an unknown physical quantity is being compared to a known physical quantity.
* A physical quantity is a variable that can be measured, for example, mass, volume, velocity, acceleration, distance, speed, time, density, pressure and others.
* There are two items to be considered when stating a physical quantity. These are:
    - The numerical value (magnitude) and
    - The unit.
        * For example in, 3 meters, 3 is the magnitude and meter is the unit.

## Quantities and units

* Physical quantities can be classified into base quantities and derived quantities.

### Base quantities

* A base quantity is one that is defined without reference to any other quantity.
* There are seven (7) base quantities.
* These are length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, the amount of substance and luminous intensity.
* The following table summarizes the base quantities and their base units.

| Base Quantities      | Base Units | Symbols |
|----------------------|------------|---------|
| **Mass** ($\operatorname{m}$)          | Kilogram   | kg      |
| **Time** ($\operatorname{t}$)           | Second     | s       |
| **Length** ($\operatorname{l}$)         | Metre      | m       |
| **Electric current** ($\operatorname{I}$)| Ampere     | A       |
| **Amount of substance**            | Mole       | mol     |
| **Temperature** ($\operatorname{T}$)    | Kelvin     | K       |
| **Luminous intensity**              | Candela    | cd      |

* All other quantities are derived from the ones above.
