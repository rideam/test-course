    ## Newtonian Mechanics

    Newtonian mechanics is most straightforward in its formulation and is based on Newton's second law. It is efficient in most cases, especially for consideration of particles under the influence of forces. Lagrangian mechanics is more sophisticated and based of the least action principle

        ## Overview

        a brief introduction to the mathematics behind physics including the addition and multiplication of vectors as well as velocity and acceleration in terms of particles.

        # Vectors

        A vector is a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties: magnitude and direction. The term also denotes the mathematical or geometrical representation of such a quantity. Examples of vectors in nature are velocity, momentum, force, electromagnetic fields, and weight.

      # Ipython notebook render examples

      The following examples were using [this ipynb file](repocur:ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb) in `ipynbs` folder of this repo.

      ## Fully rendered
      
      The following markdown was used to render the full notebook:
      
      ```
      {{ '{{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb") }}' }}
      ```

      Result:

      {{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb") }}

      ## Sliced

      We can choose which cells (by their 0-based indices) to be rendered with arg `indices`.

      For example, cells 0 through 4 can be rendered with the following markdown:


      ```
      {{ '{{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", indices=[0,1,2,3,4]) }}' }}
      ```

      Or using `jinja2` built-in function [`range`](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/#range):

      ```
      {{ '{{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", indices=range(0,4)) }}' }}
      ```

      Result:

      {{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", indices=range(0,4)) }}

      ## With markdown cleared

      Use `clear_markdown` to get the result with content of *all* markdown cells cleared:

      ```
      {{ '{{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", clear_markdown=True) }}' }}
      ```

      Result:

      {{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", clear_markdown=True) }}

      ## With code execution output cleared

      Use `clear_output` to get the result with output of *all* code cells cleared:

      Result:

      ```
      {{ '{{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", clear_output=True) }}' }}
      ```

      {{ render_notebook_cells("ipynbs/Ipynb_example.ipynb", clear_output=True) }}
