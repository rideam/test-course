      ### Physical Quantities and Units

      By the end of this sub-topic, learners should be able to:
        
        1. Express derived units as products or quotients of the base units.
        2. Use base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations.
        3. Derive physical equations using base units.
        4. Demonstrate understanding and use the convention for labelling graph axes and table columns.
        5. Use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal sub-multiples or multiples of both base and derived units: pico (p), nano (n), micro (p), milli (m), cent (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G) , tera (T).
        6. Determine the resultant of two or more coplanar vectors
        7. Represent a vector as two perpendicular components.
      
      ### Physical Quantities
      
      * Measurement is the heart of science in general, and physics in particular. In order to study or learn physics, one must be able to measure quantities.
      * When taking a measurement, an unknown physical quantity is being compared to a known physical quantity.
      * A physical quantity is a variable that can be measured, for example, mass, volume, velocity, acceleration, distance, speed, time, density, pressure and others.
      * There are two items to be considered when stating a physical quantity. These are:
          - The numerical value (magnitude) and
          - The unit.
              * For example in, 3 meters, 3 is the magnitude and meter is the unit.
      
      #### Quantities and units
      
      * Physical quantities can be classified into base quantities and derived quantities.
      
      #### Base quantities
      
      * A base quantity is one that is defined without reference to any other quantity.
      * There are seven (7) base quantities.
      * These are length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, the amount of substance and luminous intensity.
      * The following table summarizes the base quantities and their base units.
      
      | Base Quantities      | Base Units | Symbols |
      |----------------------|------------|---------|
      | **Mass** ($\operatorname{m}$)          | Kilogram   | kg      |
      | **Time** ($\operatorname{t}$)           | Second     | s       |
      | **Length** ($\operatorname{l}$)         | Metre      | m       |
      | **Electric current** ($\operatorname{I}$)| Ampere     | A       |
      | **Amount of substance**            | Mole       | mol     |
      | **Temperature** ($\operatorname{T}$)    | Kelvin     | K       |
      | **Luminous intensity**              | Candela    | cd      |
      
      * All other quantities are derived from the ones above.
